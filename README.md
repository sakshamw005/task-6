# 🔐 Password Strength Evaluation

## 📝 Objective
Understand what makes a password strong and how complexity affects its security.

## 🧪 What I Did
- Created sample passwords with different combinations of length, symbols, and case.
- Tested them using free online password strength checkers:
  - [passwordmeter.com](https://www.passwordmeter.com/)
  - [howsecureismypassword.net](https://howsecureismypassword.net/)
- Collected scores, crack times, and feedback.

## 🧠 Key Learnings
- Longer passwords are harder to crack.
- Use a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols.
- Avoid common words and patterns (e.g., `qwerty`, `password123`).
- Password managers help create and store strong, unique passwords.

## 🔓 Common Attacks Researched
- Brute Force
- Dictionary Attacks
- Credential Stuffing
- Rainbow Tables

## ✅ Best Practices for Strong Passwords
- Use 12+ characters
- Include all character types
- Avoid real words or personal info
- Never reuse passwords
